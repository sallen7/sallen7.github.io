<h1> Research Projects </h1>

  <h2> UMD-College Park Graduate Research </h2>

  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Second-Year AMSC Scientific Computing Track Project:</strong> We implemented state-of-the-art inverse optimization methods
    in Python for our Advanced Scientific Computing project (Fall 2018-Spring 2019).  The code can be found 
      <a href="https://github.com/sallen7/inverse_optimization">here</a>.  We presented on this work at JMM 2019 and INFORMS 2019.</li>
    <li> <strong>Stochastic Network Protection:</strong> For our Probabilistic Optimization (ENME725) course in Fall 2018, we worked to 
      develop code in Pyomo and PySP for Fan and Liu (2010)'s two stage stochastic network protection model with 
      complementarity constraints.  We presented the code at ECOM 2019. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2> SUNY Geneseo Undergraduate Research </h2>

  <ul>
    <li> <strong> SUNY Geneseo Mathematics Honors Thesis on Disaster Relief Logistics:</strong> After the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake, 
      the Himalayan Disaster Relief Volunteer Group distributed supplies to affected areas. We model the organization’s delivery of 
      supplies as a vehicle routing problem using Fisher and Jaikumar’s two-stage method, which allocates locations to vehicles via an 
      integer program and then uses heuristics to route the vehicles. In the allocation stage, we use the assignment problem formulation 
      to assign locations to vehicles. In the routing stage, we implement multiple heuristics for the sake of comparison. Our results 
      illustrate the open nature of the vehicle routing problem and the computational necessity of heuristics.  A pre-print of the 
      condensed version of my thesis can be found on arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00162"> here</a>.  A modified version of this pre-print is published in Volume 11 of 
      the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO) journal and can be found 
      <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Volume%2011/S01638.pdf"> here</a>.  The code corresponding to the project can be 
      found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sallen7/disaster_relief_HDRVG"> here</a>.  The condensed paper was selected as a finalist for the <a href="https://connect.informs.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=d9ba7173-6195-46ed-868c-255dab1c8f46&CommunityKey=1d5653fa-85c8-46b3-8176-869b140e5e3c&tab=digestviewer#bmd9ba7173-6195-46ed-868c-255dab1c8f46"> 2017 INFORMS Undergraduate O.R. Prize Competition </a>.
      I also presented the research at the Pi Mu Epsilon 2017 Conference and won the Mathematical Association of America Environmental 
      Mathematics Special Interest Group Student Speaker Award. </li>
    <li> <strong> Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), UCLA:</strong>
     In this project, we worked with three colleagues to design a two-stage video change-point detection method for body-worn video.  
      We presented at the 2017 Joint Mathematics Meetings and at the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics
      (NCUWM). We were published in the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online journal (SIURO), so our paper 
      can be found <a href="http://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Volume%2010/Change-point_Detection_Methods_For_Body-Worn_Video.pdf?ver=2018-02-28-145945-990">here</a>.</li>
    <li> <strong>REU at the Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory, Virginia Tech:</strong> Through this research experience, I was afforded the opportunity to work on two different 
      research projects: </li>
      <ul>
        <li> US Census Bureau Project:  SDAL’s aim was to see if additional data sources could enhance the Census’ 
          existing collection efforts.  During the summer, we as REU researchers supported two aspects of the project: 
          (1) the data source evaluation aspect where-by we created a data-base of evaluations on data sources and contacted 
          data sources when necessary and (2) the early literature review aspect in which we found methods articles.  
          The final report prepared by the laboratory can be found 
          <a href="https://www.bi.vt.edu/sdal/news/report-develops-framework-for-us-census-bureau-to-leverage-new-data-sources">here.</a></li>
        <li> Independent Research:  We were also given the freedom to design our own research project in the 
          context of Arlington County, VA’s Census data.  I decided to focus on examining those overrepresented
          among the impoverished in Arlington County.  I examined this both from individual and community points of view. 
          Contact me if you are interested in the report I prepared. </li>
      </ul> 
    <li> <strong>Independent Research on Factors Influencing SNAP Participation among Impoverished Individuals:</strong>
    I conducted this research myself without any official credit.  I’m passionate about the Supplemental Nutrition 
      Assistance Program (SNAP) and have actually screened people for eligibility.  I stumbled across a government data 
      set that allowed me to examine the ratio of SNAP participants to impoverished people in US Counties and thought it
      would be interesting to use regression analysis to try to find factors that might be influencing this ratio.  
      I gave several presentations at regional conferences.</li>
  </ul>
