<h1> Research Projects </h1>

  <h2> UMD-College Park Graduate Research </h2>

  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Second-Year AMSC Scientific Computing Track Project:</strong> We implemented state-of-the-art inverse optimization methods
    in Python for our Advanced Scientific Computing project (Fall 2018-Spring 2019).  The code can be found 
      <a href="https://github.com/sallen7/inverse_optimization">here</a>.  We presented on this work at JMM 2019 and INFORMS 2019.</li>
    <li> <strong>Stochastic Network Protection:</strong> For my Probabilistic Optimization (ENME725) course in Fall 2018, we worked to 
      develop code in Pyomo and PySP for Fan and Liu (2010)'s two stage stochastic network protection model with 
      complementarity constraints.  We presented the code at ECOM 2019. </li>

  <h2> SUNY Geneseo Undergraduate Research </h2>

  <ul>
    <li> <strong> SUNY Geneseo Mathematics Honors Thesis on Disaster Relief Logistics:</strong> After the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake, 
      the Himalayan Disaster Relief Volunteer Group distributed supplies to affected areas. We model the organization’s delivery of 
      supplies as a vehicle routing problem using Fisher and Jaikumar’s two-stage method, which allocates locations to vehicles via an 
      integer program and then uses heuristics to route the vehicles. In the allocation stage, we use the assignment problem formulation 
      to assign locations to vehicles. In the routing stage, we implement multiple heuristics for the sake of comparison. Our results 
      illustrate the open nature of the vehicle routing problem and the computational necessity of heuristics.  A pre-print of the 
      condensed version of my thesis can be found on arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00162"> here</a>.  A modified version of this pre-print is published in Volume 11 of 
      the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO) journal and can be found 
      <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Volume%2011/S01638.pdf"> here</a>.  The code corresponding to the project can be 
      found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sallen7/disaster_relief_HDRVG"> here</a>.  The condensed paper was selected as a finalist for the <a href="https://connect.informs.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=d9ba7173-6195-46ed-868c-255dab1c8f46&CommunityKey=1d5653fa-85c8-46b3-8176-869b140e5e3c&tab=digestviewer#bmd9ba7173-6195-46ed-868c-255dab1c8f46"> 2017 INFORMS Undergraduate O.R. Prize Competition </a>.
      I also presented the research at the Pi Mu Epsilon 2017 Conference and won the Mathematical Association of America Environmental 
      Mathematics Special Interest Group Student Speaker Award. </li>
    <li> <strong> Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), UCLA:</strong>
     In this project, we worked with three colleagues to design a two-stage video change-point detection method for body-worn video.  
      We presented at the 2017 Joint Mathematics Meetings and at the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics
      (NCUWM). We were published in the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online journal (SIURO), so our paper 
      can be found <a href="http://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Volume%2010/Change-point_Detection_Methods_For_Body-Worn_Video.pdf?ver=2018-02-28-145945-990">here</a>.</li>
