    <li> <strong> SUNY Geneseo Mathematics Honors Thesis on Disaster Relief Logistics </strong>: After the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake, 
      the Himalayan Disaster Relief Volunteer Group distributed supplies to affected areas. We model the organization’s delivery of 
      supplies as a vehicle routing problem using Fisher and Jaikumar’s two-stage method, which allocates locations to vehicles via an 
      integer program and then uses heuristics to route the vehicles. In the allocation stage, we use the assignment problem formulation 
      to assign locations to vehicles. In the routing stage, we implement multiple heuristics for the sake of comparison. Our results 
      illustrate the open nature of the vehicle routing problem and the computational necessity of heuristics.  A pre-print of the 
      condensed version of my thesis can be found on arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00162"> here</a>.  A modified version of this pre-print is published in Volume 11 of 
      the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO) journal and can be found <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Volume%2011/S01638.pdf"> here </a>.  The code corresponding to the project can be 
      found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sallen7/disaster_relief_HDRVG"> here </a>.  The condensed paper was selected as a finalist for the <a href="https://connect.informs.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=d9ba7173-6195-46ed-868c-255dab1c8f46&CommunityKey=1d5653fa-85c8-46b3-8176-869b140e5e3c&tab=digestviewer#bmd9ba7173-6195-46ed-868c-255dab1c8f46"> 2017 INFORMS Undergraduate O.R. Prize Competition </a>.
      I also presented the research at the Pi Mu Epsilon 2017 Conference and won the Mathematical Association of America Environmental 
      Mathematics Special Interest Group Student Speaker Award. </li>
